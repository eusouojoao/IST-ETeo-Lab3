The RLC series circuit is a fundamental electrical circuit comprising a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series. When subjected to an alternating sinusoidal voltage from the variable frequency generator, the circuit exhibits interesting behaviors based on the applied frequency. One crucial phenomenon is resonance, where the circuit responds most effectively to a specific frequency.
